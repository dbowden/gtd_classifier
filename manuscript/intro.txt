# Introduction

Scholars of armed conflict are increasingly shifting their focus from the national level in favor of devoting greater attention to specific rebel and terrorist organizations [e.g. @Bakke2012; @Staniland2014]. At the same time, the discipline has seen a proliferation in highly disaggregated events data such as ACLED [cite], GED [cite], ICEWS [cite], and GTD [cite]. Conducting research at the intersection of these two trends is surprisingly difficult, however, as many violent events cannot be attributed to a particular actor. For example, GED attributes XX% of the events in the Syrian Civil War to a generic 'Syrian Insurgents' actor. Similarly, XX% of the perpetrators in GTD are listed as 'Unknown.' This lack of information is rarely the fault of the researchers who compile these datasets. Rather, non-state actors often obscure their use of violence to avoid retribution or criminal liability, and even when the identity of a perpetrator is knowable, such details are sometimes omitted from the news articles that comprise the bulk of the source material for events datasets. Nevertheless, these missing data problems create a substantial risk of bias in studies of individual actors in conflict.

In this paper, I demonstrate that machine learning can be used to identify the perpetrators of violent events with a high degree of accuracy.
